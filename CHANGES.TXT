--TODO--


--0.17--

   !	Minor changes for Buf API changes.

   !	sample.mc.in: Removed from define(`_FFR_MILTER', `1')dnl

--0.16--

   !	Fixed possible off by one error for body chunks less than 20
   	bytes. Reported by Ben Lentz.

--0.15--

  !!	Replaced use of buffered output from the milter to the CLI child
	process with unbuffered I/O. Simplifies the code and avoids
	possible I/O blocking when closing the milter to child stream.

--0.14--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.63.

   !	Restore verbose=info default so that script output is initally
   	logged.

   !	Fixed potential problem between mixed models by doing timeouts
	on the file descriptor, but using buffered input.

   !	It would appear you still have to call waitpid() after even a
	SIGKILL (terminate with extreme prejudice).

   !	cmdStart() asserts that no unnecessary file descriptors remain
   	open in the child process, by closing everything other than
   	standard in (0), out (1), and error (2).

  !!	filterBody(): Fixed obsecure bug when the message content is
	less than 20 bytes long, adding a terminating NUL to the body
	chunk for the trace log output actually overwrote off the end
	of a dynamic buffer on some Linux systems causing the milter
	to crash. Reported by Martin Lathoud.

   +	access-db now supports socket-map, flat-file, and SQLite3
	lookups in addition to Berkeley DB. The SQLite3 behaviour
	can be disabled via LibSnert's ./configure script.

   !	Removed DEFAULT_COMMAND /bin/true in favour of NULL.

--0.13--

  !!	License 1.4 which provides additional details with regards to
  	possible license controls used, the possibility of "phone
  	home code" and its general contents, and related privacy
  	statement.

   +	Add check for filterOpen() got NULL socket address pointer
	passed to filterOpen() which inidicates an unsupported address
	type. The connection is simply accepted to bypass the milter.

--0.12--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.61.

  !!	Complete replacement of option specification and no backwards.
	compatibility. The newer format allows for better integration
	of previously undocumented libsnert options and for the
	inclusion of future enhancements.

   !	filterClose(): remove reporting of "null workspace error",
	which can occur when a client connection is rejected before or
	by filterOpen().

   !	Minor corrections for gcc -Wall warnings and errors.

--0.11--

   !	Reverted back to libmilter's default (7210s) timeout. This
	should silence many of the reported sendmail to milter timeout
	errors and/or broken connections caused by the milter timing
	out sooner than sendmail does with the current SMTP client.
	The sendmail defaults for each SMTP command and receiving the
	message content is 1h each and so libmilter allows for 2h 10s.
	But in theory you could be DoS for between 5 and 104 hours per
	connection. If you want to change this then set in
	sendmail.mc:

		define(`confTO_DATABLOCK',      `30m')
		define(`confTO_COMMAND',        `5m')

--0.10--

   !	Increased recommended EOM timeout for INPUT_MAIL_FILTER().

--0.9--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.57

   !	When the -e command returns DISCARD, TAG, BCC, or REDIRECT,
   	then skip executing the -c command as documented. Reported
   	by Sergey N. Romanov.

   !	Add -H option to enable adding of X-Scanned-By headers. This
   	changes the default behaviour to be disabled. Requested by
   	Sergey N. Romanov.

   !	When an I/O error occurs, ie. broken pipe, then we should
   	still collect the child process status, otherwise zombie
   	processess ensue. Reported by Sergey N. Romanov.

   +	Added support for

   		milter-length-auth:auth_authen	RHS
   		milter-length-auth:

--0.8--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.56

   !	Changed install.sh.in to create /var/run/mitler/ directory
   	owned by milter:milter and change the default PID_FILE and
   	SOCKET_FILE paths. This provides better privelage/security
   	separation since the milters run as milter:milter.

   +	More dialog debugging added to cmdStop() and filterData() for -e.

--0.7--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.53

   !	filterRcpt() minor change to account for LibSnert smfAccessRcpt()
   	change to keep the old skipMessage behaviour until ready.

   !	cmdStart() now does setuid() to effective user-id before invoking
   	any command line script or command.

--0.6--

   +	After invoking the -e or -c commands, write the sendmail
   	message ID to the command's standard input along with
   	the other parameters. Useful for creating temporary file
   	names or logging by the script.

   	NOTE that this change will require changes to scripts and
	programs called by milter-cli. See manual.shtml for order.

--0.5--

   +	Modify filterRcpt() so as to be sure all recipients, except
   	those blacklisted, are added to the recipients list passed
   	to the -e CLI.

   +	The CLI return codes for copy (5) and redirect (6) now allow
   	for both recipients addresses and an X-Milter-CLI-Report header.
   	Report lines can be interleaved with recipients on standard
   	output from the CLI, provided the report lines contain a space
   	character.

--0.4--

   !	Fixed potential file descriptor leak.

   !	Fixed potential zombie child processes.

--0.3--

   +	filterEndMessage(): now tests skipMessage (white list) flag,
	rather relying on cmdStop() to detect that no child process
	was started. This also means that the addition of the X-
	Scanned-By header is skipped. For local outbound messages,
	this should improve performance, in particular for any local
	mailing lists.

   !	Fixed hasInput() when using poll(): changed POLLHUP condition
	to return EPIPE only once all input has been exhausted.

--0.2--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.41 build 716+.

   +	Added the -e envelope command. Is only available IF sendmail
	and libmilter were built with -DSMFI_VERSION=4 or better. The
	envelope command has priority to tempfail, reject, or discard
	the message. Otherwise the content command will have a chance.
	It is possible to double-tag or have mixed copy/redirect
	results from both commands.

   +	Added support for multiple instances.

   +	More AWK examples.

   !	Fixed multiple broken pipe errors for large messages, because
   	a script terminated early and was no longer accepting input.

--0.1--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.41 build 713+
